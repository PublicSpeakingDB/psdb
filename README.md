- **Generate a DeepGram API Key:** [Instructions](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/create-additional-api-keys)
- Store this key in a safe place.
- **Important Note:** The way that Public Speaking Dashboard is configured, this API key is exposed to whoever has access to the the App when it is deployed on Netlify. The DeepGram service is free, but, even so, share the link only with intended audiences.
